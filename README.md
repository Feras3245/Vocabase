# Vocabase
## About
Vocabase is a Python command-line tool designed to automate the extraction of detailed information about German terms from popular online German-English dictionaries, specifically [Linguee.com](http://Linguee.com) and [wiktionary.org](http://wiktionary.org/). 

The inspiration behind Vocabase was to streamline my German language learning process by automating vocabulary collection. I use [Notion.io](http://Notion.io) as a primary platform to organize study notes, guides, and an extensive vocabulary database where I log every new German word I encounter. Initially, manually entering each term was time-consuming, prompting me to develop a tool to automate this process and improve efficiency.

After exploring various public German-English APIs, I found that they all had limitations for my use case, such as missing critical information, incomplete definitions, or access restrictions behind a paywall. Vocabase addresses these gaps by web scraping my preferred online dictionaries, providing complete control over the data collected for my Notion-based database.

Vocabase queries a German term and makes GET requests to the search functions of [Linguee.com](http://linguee.com) and [wiktionary.org](https://www.wiktionary.org/), using the `BeautifulSoup4` library to scrape and extract key details, such as sentence context, definitions, grammatical forms, articles, plurals (for nouns), and example usages.

The data is presented in a user-friendly tabular format, where each distinct result (lemma) is displayed in a separate table. Users can then utilize SQL-like commands to `insert`, `edit`, or `delete` any entries, offering a flexible and efficient way to manage vocabulary data.
## Warnings

### Data Extraction Disclaimer

This project is intended solely for personal use. [Linguee.com](http://linguee.com) and its parent company, DeepL SE, expressly prohibit unauthorized scraping of their data. Use of this tool without appropriate precautions, such as a VPN or proxy service, may lead to a permanent IP ban from Linguee and expose you to potential copyright or legal liabilities.

### API Key and Database Configuration

For security reasons, the Notion database ID and Notion API secret key have been removed from the **`Notion_API_Handler.py`** file (lines 24 and 28, respectively).

To test this tool, youâ€™ll need to generate your own Notion API key via the [Notion API](https://developers.notion.com/) and create an integration linked to your personal Notion database. Ensure that your database is named `Vocabase` and matches the structure of the original for proper functionality.

For detailed setup information, please refer to the [Notion API Overview](https://developers.notion.com/docs/getting-started).
